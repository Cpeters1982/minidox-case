# Minidox Case

A 3D-printed case for the [Minidox][].

## What You Should Print

Each half will need a case and a top.  If you want to print the cover
too, make sure you print the case that has the cover option.

# What to Expect

After getting everything put together you will probably need to trim
some of the key cap openings on the top plate.

Regrettably, I designed the case to have a little bit of wiggle room
to make inserting the PCB easier.  But this means the PCB and top
plate may not align correctly.
